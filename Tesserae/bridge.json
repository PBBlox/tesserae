    // Because Bridge will monkey about with JS file names depending upon build configuration (only ".min.js" for Release builds and NO ".min.js" for Debug builds), we need to be a bit
    // careful with how external JS files are referenced. We COULD maintain minified and regular versions of all libraries in this project and then individually reference all of them
    // twice (once min'd and once not) in this section but that seems like a lot of work. An alternative is to bundle them together - once as a ".min.js" file and again as a non-".min.js"
    // file. This is still a bit of a faff because the file lists appear twice and we need to be careful to keep them in sync. Maybe Bridge will change the behaviour one day regarding the
    // file name changes - if there is no "jquery.js" file then it shouldn't rename "jquery.min.js" when in Debug configuration! (See https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Bridge/issues/3992).
